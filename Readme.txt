Mod adds new towns & creatures in game.


-------------------------------
Installation:

This mod requires Homm III + Era Wog 3.9 platform.    You should unzip Land of New Towns mod, copy it to Mods folder, and enable it in mod manager. Mod compatible with WOG, ERA Scripts (tested on ERa 3.9.14 (assembly v2.101)). Also work with Human AI mod.   Please disable other mods for compatibility

Important! Add this line in HommHD launcher -> Tweaks tab  (this is needed for correct display  Bastion townscreen):
<Fix.Cosmetic> = 0 




Tips:
For better immersion in the game before the start dialog in mod for selecting a new town, you can select the starting town in the standard Heroes3 options when generating map - this affects the appearance of the terrain around the town. For example, for Knigh's Castle it is better to select "Castle town", for "Forest town" select "Rampart".

Also, in the mod homepage you can download high-res textures for standart homm3 towns (Castle, Rampart... Conflux)

2.0
The new version support for adding new towns (adding as new ones, not replacing as it was done before). The total number of towns became 11. All this was done by using ERM scripts.
To play for new towns choose their base on start (Rampart==Eldorado, Dungeon==ShadowTown, Stronghold==SandTown). New towns generated randomly - default town or new town. For example, If you want to play ShadowTown  - choose Dungeon on start. If ShadowTown does not appear (appear Dungeon) - simple restart scenario.
Known bugs/features
- Small icons of towns not supported 
- supported maps from L size and the number of towns 8 
- In town switching dialog, the background and dwellings do not change. (If you enter the town separately by clicking on town or entering by hero - all working)
