Installation:

This mod requires Homm III + Era Wog 3.9 platform.    You should enable this mod in mod manager. Mod compatible with WOG, ERA Scripts (tested on ERa 3.9.x (assembly v2.101)). Also work with Human AI mod.   Please disable other mods for compatibility

Important! Add this line in HommHD launcher -> Tweaks tab  (this is needed for correct display  Bastion townscreen):
<Fix.Cosmetic> = 0 




Tips:
For better immersion in the game before the start dialog in mod for selecting a new town, you can select the starting town in the standard Heroes3 options when generating map - this affects the appearance of the terrain around the town. For example, for Knigh's Castle it is better to select "Castle town", for "Forest town" select "Rampart".

Also, in the mod homepage you can download high-res textures for standart homm3 towns (Castle, Rampart... Conflux)
