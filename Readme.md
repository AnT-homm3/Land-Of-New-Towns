-------------------------------------------------
* The default Heroes 3 town selection (Castle,Rampart...Conflux) before map generation affects the terrain around the starting town.   For example, for "Forest town" select "Rampart" (grass), for "IceCastle" or "ElementalPalace" select Tower(snow).
* To select a start town for multiplayer, edit the options file "...\Mods\Land Of New Towns\Data\s\___options.erm"
* On the mod homepage (https://sites.google.com/view/landofnewtowns)  you can download high-res textures for standart Homm3 towns (Castle, Rampart... Conflux) and some map objects
